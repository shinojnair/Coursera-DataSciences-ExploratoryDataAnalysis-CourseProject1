## Coursera DataSciences Exploratory Data Analysis Course Project 1

### Purpose
To demonstrate ability to plot graphs using the Base Plotting System in r. 

### Goal 
To construct plots and save it into PNG files with width 480 pixels and height 480 pixels.

### Data for the project 
Data on "Individual Househole electric power consumption dataset" from UC Irwine Machine Learning Repository

Data URL:- https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

Data File:- household_power_consumption.txt

UCI Website:- http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/

### Data Information
Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02 for the ploting assignment. 

### Project Instructions
Link to the Course Assignment Instruction GitHub Repository: https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

For each plot

1. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

2. Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

3. Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.

4. dd the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)
